Description of the tests:
Due to limitations of active(live) software application, I could not simulate all the test scenarios that have been described in the test cases sheet.

TC_001: Verifies whether the application displays search results for the given search keyword.
TC_002: Verify whether the application has feature for applying jobs by registering a user and uploading CV.
TC_004: Verify that the application displays all the jobs/positions and the status of the applications the user had applied.
TC_006: Verify whether the user can apply for a new job with the existing profile and cv.


I had performed exploratory testing and identified some issues in the job profile page.
there is a discrepancy in names of applied jobs.
I have attached detailed video if the bug.
